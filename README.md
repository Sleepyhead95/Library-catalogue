# Library Catalogue

This project is part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer course. Here, I was tasked with creating JavaScript classes to organize the content of a media store called Books-'N-Stuff. The store carries three types of media: Books, Movies, and CDs. These will become the child classes that will help us keep the store products organized.
